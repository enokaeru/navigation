## Learning  Algorithm
I adapt priorities replay buffer, dueling network, double dqn, Multi-step learning.
Hyper parameters are below, along to paper, git-hub repository.



## Plot of Rewords


## Ideas for Future Work
- I don't try to implement distribution DQN, Noise-Net from Rainbow.
I'd like to try to experiment those method, observe how effective they are.
- The agent should select action that quite depends on previous time. I think to be better that it adapt memory structure.
 I'd like to implement stacked input on DQN or LSTM on A2C.
